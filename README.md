# SauceDemo
The final project involved performing both manual and automated tests on the eCommerce and shopping site www.saucedemo.com. Manually to fully understand the project and the client's needs, testing critical functions like login, adding items to the cart, and checkout. Following the completion of this stage, I started creating automated testing using Selenium, POM and DDT.
